Education builds a nation, therefore, it’s imperative to improve this sector. It would be insincerity to say the educational system in the state is okay. The curriculum is outdated and the infrastructures is nothing to write home about especially in government owned schools and institutions. Then there are thousands of children not in school even when education has been made free in Akwa-Ibom state.

              One of the major reasons poverty is in the land is unemployment. Unemployment in the nation is very high. According to the National Bureau of Statistics as at 2020, data shows that about 21.7 million Nigerians are unemployed of which 13.9 million are youth. An increase in youth unemployment in any nation will mean an increase in poverty which leads to insecurity and crime.

              To curb this there has to be creation of more jobs. But looking critically at the issue of unemployment, you’ll find out that a lot of the unemployed citizens, especially the youth don’t have the necessary skills and education to hold a job. To solve this, while jobs are being created, people should be trained on some technical skills, vocational skills and the entrepreneurial skills. This way they are employable.

              Electricity is one of the basic needs a government should provide for its citizens but some communities can’t boast of steady light. While some areas have forgotten how it feels to have light in the community. It’s worst for business owners who now have to find alternatives to have light and run their businesses.
